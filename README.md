# Data Science Project: From Basics to Advanced

This repository contains a comprehensive Data Science project that progresses from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques, ideal for beginners to experienced practitioners. The project covers various stages of the data science workflow, including:

- **Data Collection**: Importing and processing raw datasets from multiple sources.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Basic Models**: Implementing and comparing foundational algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Using ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost), hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation metrics.
- **Machine Learning Pipelines**: Automating the workflow with scalable and reusable pipelines.
- **Deep Learning**: A basic introduction to Neural Networks and implementation using TensorFlow/Keras for classification tasks.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploying the trained model as a web service using Flask or FastAPI.

### Key Features:
- **Jupyter Notebooks** with detailed explanations of each step.
- **End-to-End Project**: From data exploration to model deployment.
- **Use Cases**: Real-world applications in sales forecasting, customer churn prediction, and image classification.
